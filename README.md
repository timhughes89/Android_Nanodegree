## Project 01 - Sandwich Club
<strong>Project Overview</strong> - Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.

## Project 02 - Popular Movies - Part 1
<strong>Project Overview</strong> - Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:original title movie poster image thumbnail. A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)user rating (called vote_average in the api)release date.

## Project 03 - Popular Movies - Part 2
<strong>Project Overview</strong> - In this stage you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.
You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*. You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
